Years ago, there was an article in the Circuit Cellar colum of Byte
Magazine that discussed converting text to speech using sound rules.  This
may have been back in 1984. I had decided to build a synthesizer ('ll scan
the schematic and upload it when I find it) and write software in
Pascal/MT+ on a CP/M machine.

There is some 8080 assembly language code that I wrote so that I could output
data to/input data from the required I/O ports (the parallel port) to drive
the synthesizer with a byte stream of encoded phonem values to make it talk.

I've only created this repository for historical reasons. As I become older,
I realize that the only way that this code can continue to exist is for me
to upload it to some place that provides public access.

I've noticed that the Festival application that I've played with on my
Linux system produces similar sound quality (maybe better), so this code
provides no additional information other than to portray *another* way to
do things.

If anything, people may chuckle with respect to my coding style back in
1984.
